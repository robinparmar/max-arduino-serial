# plotArduino
Demonstrates how to transfer data from Arduino to Max over simple serial (USB) connection. 

Physical requirements:
* an Arduino connected with its USB cable to your computer
* three (for this example) sensors connected to analogue pins
* optional LED connected to digital pin 13

Code requirements:
* load the appropriate Arduino sketch to the board
* load the patch into Max

Possible issues:
* identifying the serial port can be annoying, especially on MacOS
* just see which new connection appears when connecting the board
